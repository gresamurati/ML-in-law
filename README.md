## Motivation

<br>
The legal industry has been slow to embrace technology and automate some of the tasks that are done manually. However, incorporating technology into legal work can help law firms increase their productivity and help find interesting insights from legal data. Since legal documents are lengthy and detailed, it can easily cause the reader to have difficulties in discerning the main topics of the document.
For this project, we were interested in discovering underlying topics of 45  landmark supreme court cases that have shaped the American history.
