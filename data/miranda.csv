 With him the brief was Marguerite Oberto
" Anthony Amsterdam, Paul Mishkin, Raymond Bradley, Peter Hearn and Melvin Wulf filed brief for the American Civil Liberties Union, amicus curiae, all cases"
MR  CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion the Court
 The cases before raise questions which the roots our concepts American criminal jurisprudence: the restraints society must observe consistent with the Federal Constitution prosecuting individuals for crime
" More specifically, deal with the admissibility statements obtained from individual who subjected custodial police interrogation and the necessity for procedures which assure that the individual accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment the Constitution not compelled incriminate himself"
" There, the four cases before us, law enforcement officials took the defendant into custody and interrogated him police station for the purpose obtaining confession"
 The police did not effectively advise him his right remain silent his right consult with his attorney
" Rather, they confronted him with alleged accomplice who accused him having perpetrated murder"
" When the defendant denied the accusation and said didn't shoot Manuel, you did it,"" they handcuffed him and took him interrogation room"
" There, while handcuffed and standing, was questioned for four hours until confessed"
" During this interrogation, the police denied his request speak his attorney, and they prevented his retained attorney, who had come the police station, from consulting with him"
" his trial, the State, over his objection, introduced the confession against him"
 held that the statements thus made were constitutionally inadmissible
 This case has been the subject judicial interpretation and spirited legal debate since was decided two years ago
" Both state and federal courts, assessing its implications, have arrived varying conclusions"
 wealth scholarly material has been written tracing its ramifications and underpinnings
" Police and prosecutor have speculated its range and desirability, granted certiorari these cases order further explore some facets the problems, thus exposed, applying the privilege against self-incrimination in-custody interrogation, and give concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts follow"
" start here, did Escobedo, with the premise that our holding not innovation our jurisprudence, but application principles long recognized and applied other settings"
" have undertaken thorough re-examination the Escobedo decision and the principles announced, and reaffirm it"
" That case was but explication basic rights that are enshrined our Constitution that ""No person shall compelled any criminal case witness against himself,"" and that ""the accused shall have the Assistance Counsel"" rights which were put jeopardy that case through official overbearing"
 These precious rights were fixed our Constitution only after centuries persecution and struggle
" And the words Chief Justice Marshall, they were secured ""for ages come, and designed approach immortality nearly human institutions can approach it,"" Cohens Virginia, Wheat"
" Over years ago, our predecessors this Court eloquently stated: ""The maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare had its origin protest against the inquisitorial and manifestly unjust methods interrogating accused persons, which [have] long obtained the continental system, and, until the expulsion the Stuarts from the British throne 1688, and the erection additional barriers for the protection the people against the exercise arbitrary power, [were] not uncommon even England"
" While the admissions confessions the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high the scale incriminating evidence, accused person asked explain his apparent connection with crime under investigation, the ease with which the questions put him may assume inquisitorial character, the temptation press the witness unduly, browbeat him timid reluctant, push him into corner, and entrap him into fatal contradictions, which painfully evident many the earlier state trials, notably those Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and Udal, the Puritan minister, made the system odious give rise demand for its total abolition"
" The change the English criminal procedure that particular seems founded upon statute and judicial opinion, but upon general and silent acquiescence the courts popular demand"
" But, however adopted, has become firmly embedded English, well American jurisprudence"
" deeply did the iniquities the ancient system impress themselves upon the minds the American colonists that the States, with one accord, made denial the right question accused person part their fundamental law, that maxim, which England was mere rule evidence, became clothed this country with the impregnability constitutional enactment"
" stating the obligation the judiciary apply these constitutional rights, this Court declared Weems United States: our contemplation cannot only what has been but what may be"
 Under any other rule constitution would indeed easy application would deficient efficacy and power
 Its general principles would have little value and converted precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas
 Rights declared words might lost reality
 And this has been recognized
The meaning and vitality the Constitution have developed against narrow and restrictive construction
""" This was the spirit which delineated, meaningful language, the manner which the constitutional rights the individual could enforced against overzealous police practices"
" was necessary Escobedo, here, insure that what was proclaimed the Constitution had not become but ""form words,"" Silverthorne Lumber Co"
" United States, the hands government officials"
" And this spirit, consistent with our role judges, that adhere the principles Escobedo today"
" Our holding will spelled out with some specificity the pages which follow but briefly stated this: the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation the defendant unless demonstrates the use procedural safeguards effective secure the privilege against self-incrimination"
" custodial interrogation, mean questioning initiated law enforcement officers after person has been taken into custody otherwise deprived his freedom action any significant way"
" for the procedural safeguards employed, unless other fully effective means are devised inform accused persons their right silence and assure continuous opportunity exercise it, the following measures are required"
" Prior any questioning, the person must warned that has right remain silent, that any statement does make may used evidence against him, and that has right the presence attorney, either retained appointed"
" The defendant may waive effectuation these rights, provided the waiver made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently"
" If, however, indicates any manner and any stage the process that wishes consult with attorney before speaking there can questioning"
" Likewise, the individual alone and indicates any manner that does not wish interrogated, the police may not question him"
 The mere fact that may have answered some questions volunteered some statements his own does not deprive him the right refrain from answering any further inquiries until has consulted with attorney and thereafter consents questioned
 The constitutional issue decide each these cases the admissibility statements obtained from defendant questioned while custody otherwise deprived his freedom action any significant way
" each, the defendant was questioned police officers, detectives, prosecuting attorney room which was cut off from the outside world"
 none these cases was the defendant given full and effective warning his rights the outset the interrogation process
" all the cases, the questioning elicited oral admissions, and three them, signed statements well which were admitted their trials"
" They all thus share salient features incommunicado interrogation individuals police-dominated atmosphere, resulting self-incriminating statements without full warnings constitutional rights"
 understanding the nature and setting this in-custody interrogation essential our decisions today
 The difficulty depicting what transpires such interrogations stems from the fact that this country they have largely taken place incommunicado
" From extensive factual studies undertaken the early 1930's, including the famous Wickersham Report Congress Presidential Commission, clear that police violence and the ""third degree"" flourished that timeseries cases decided this Court long after these studies, the police resorted physical brutality beating, hanging, whipping and sustained and protracted questioning incommunicado order extort confessions"
" The Commission Civil Rights 1961 found much evidence indicate that ""some policemen still resort physical force obtain confessions,"" 1961 Comm'n Civil Rights Rep, Justice"


" The use physical brutality and violence not, unfortunately, relegated the past any part the country"
" Only recently Kings County, New York, the police brutally beat, kicked and placed lighted cigarette butts the back potential witness under interrogation for the purpose securing statement incriminating third party"
" People Portelli, 235, 205 857, 257 931 (1965)"
"The examples given above are undoubtedly the exception now, but they are sufficiently widespread the object concern"
 Unless proper limitation upon custodial interrogation achieved such these decisions will advance there can assurance that practices this nature will eradicated the foreseeable future
" The conclusion the Wickersham Commission Report, made over years ago, still pertinent: ""To the contention that the third degree necessary get the facts, the reporters aptly reply the language the present Lord Chancellor England (Lord Sankey): `It not admissible great right doing little wrong"
 not sufficient justice obtaining proper result irregular improper means
"' Not only does the use the third degree involve flagrant violation law the officers the law, but involves also the dangers false confessions, and tends make police and prosecutors less zealous the search for objective evidence"
" the New York prosecutor quoted the report said, `It short cut and makes the police lazy and unenterprising"
" Or, another official quoted remarked: `If you use your fists, you are not likely use your wits"
"' agree with the conclusion expressed the report, that `The third degree brutalizes the police, hardens the prisoner against society, and lowers the esteem which the administration justice held the public"
"'"" National Commission Law Observance and Enforcement, Report Lawlessness Law Enforcement (1931)"
 Again stress that the modern practice in-custody interrogation psychologically rather than physically oriented
" have stated before, ""Since Chambers Florida, this Court has recognized that coercion can mental well physical, and that the blood the accused not the only hallmark unconstitutional inquisition"
 Interrogation still takes place privacy
 Privacy results secrecy and this turn results gap our knowledge what fact goes the interrogation rooms
" valuable source information about present police practices, however, may found various police manuals and texts which document procedures employed with success the past, and which recommend various other effective tactics"
These texts are used law enforcement agencies themselves guides
 should noted that these texts professedly present the most enlightened and effective means presently used obtain statements through custodial interrogation
" considering these texts and other data, possible describe procedures observed and noted around the country"
" The officers are told the manuals that the ""principal psychological factor contributing successful interrogation privacy being alone with the person under interrogation"
""" The efficacy this tactic has been explained follows: ""If all practicable, the interrogation should take place the investigator's office least room his own choice"
 The subject should deprived every psychological advantage
" his own home may confident, indignant, recalcitrant"
 more keenly aware his rights and more reluctant tell his indiscretions criminal behavior within the walls his home
" Moreover his family and other friends are nearby, their presence lending moral support"
" his own office, the investigator possesses all the advantages"
 The atmosphere suggests the invincibility the forces the law
""" highlight the isolation and unfamiliar surroundings, the manuals instruct the police display air confidence the suspect's guilt and from outward appearance maintain only interest confirming certain details"
 The guilt the subject posited fact
" The interrogator should direct his comments toward the reasons why the subject committed the act, rather than court failure asking the subject whether did it"
" Like other men, perhaps the subject has had bad family life, had unhappy childhood, had too much drink, had unrequited desire for women"
" The officers are instructed minimize the moral seriousness the offense, cast blame the victim society"
 These tactics are designed put the subject psychological state where his story but elaboration what the police purport know already that guilty
 Explanations the contrary are dismissed and discouraged
 The texts thus stress that the major qualities interrogator should possess are patience and perseverance
"One writer describes the efficacy these characteristics this manner: ""In the preceding paragraphs emphasis has been placed kindness and stratagems"
" The investigator will, however, encounter many situations where the sheer weight his personality will the deciding factor"
" Where emotional appeals and tricks are employed avail, must rely oppressive atmosphere dogged persistence"
" must interrogate steadily and without relent, leaving the subject prospect surcease"
 must dominate his subject and overwhelm him with his inexorable will obtain the truth
 should interrogate for spell several hours pausing only for the subject's necessities acknowledgment the need avoid charge duress that can technically substantiated
" serious case, the interrogation may continue for days, with the required intervals for food and sleep, but with respite from the atmosphere domination"
 possible this way induce the subject talk without resorting duress coercion
 The method should used only when the guilt the subject appears highly probable
""" The manuals suggest that the suspect offered legal excuses for his actions order obtain initial admission guilt"
" Where there suspected revenge-killing, for example, the interrogator may say: ""Joe, you probably didn't out looking for this fellow with the purpose shooting him"
" guess is, however, that you expected something from him and that's why you carried gun for your own protection"
" You knew him for what was, good"
" Then when you met him probably started using foul, abusive language and gave some indication  that was about pull gun you, and that's when you had act save your own life"
" That's about it, isn't it, Joe?"" Having then obtained the admission shooting, the interrogator advised refer circumstantial evidence which negates the self-defense explanation"
 This should enable him secure the entire story
" One text notes that ""Even fails so, the inconsistency between the subject's original denial the shooting and his present admission least doing the shooting will serve deprive him self-defense `out' the time trial"
""" When the techniques described above prove unavailing, the texts recommend they alternated with show some hostility"
" One ploy often used has been termed the ""friendly-unfriendly"" the ""Mutt and Jeff"" act: this technique, two agents are employed"
" Mutt, the relentless investigator, who knows the subject guilty and not going waste any time"
 He's sent dozen men away for this crime and he's going send the subject away for the full term
" Jeff, the other hand, obviously kindhearted man"
 has family himself
 has brother who was involved little scrape like this
 disapproves Mutt and his tactics and will arrange get him off the case the subject will cooperate
 can't hold Mutt off for very long
 The subject would wise make quick decision
 The technique applied having both investigators present while Mutt acts out his role
 Jeff may stand quietly and demur some Mutt's tactics
" When Jeff makes his plea for cooperation, Mutt not present the room"
The interrogators sometimes are instructed induce confession out trickery
 The technique here quite effective crimes which require identification which run series
" the identification situation, the interrogator may take break his questioning place the subject among group men line-up"
" ""The witness complainant (previously coached, necessary) studies the line-up and confidently points out the subject the guilty party"
""" Then the questioning resumes ""as though there were now doubt about the guilt the subject"
""" variation this technique called the ""reverse line-up"": ""The accused placed line-up, but this time identified several fictitious witnesses victims who associated him with different offenses"
 expected that the subject will become desperate and confess the offense under investigation order escape from the false accusations
""" The manuals also contain instructions for police how handle the individual who refuses discuss the matter entirely, who asks for attorney relatives"
 The examiner concede him the right remain silent
" ""This usually has very undermining effect"
" First all, disappointed his expectation unfavorable reaction the part the interrogator"
" Secondly, concession this right remain silent impresses  the subject with the apparent fairness his interrogator"
""" After this psychological conditioning, however, the officer told point out the incriminating significance the suspect's refusal talk: ""Joe, you have right remain silent"
 That's your privilege and I'm the last person the world who'll try take away from you
" that's the way you want leave this, But let ask you this"
" Suppose you were shoes and were yours and you called ask about this and told you, don't want answer any your questions"
"' You'd think had something hide, and you'd probably right thinking that"
" That's exactly what I'll have think about you, and will everybody else"
 let's sit here and talk this whole thing over
""" Few will persist their initial refusal talk, said, this monologue employed correctly"
" the event that the subject wishes speak relative attorney, the following advice tendered: ""[T]he interrogator should respond suggesting that the subject first tell the truth the interrogator himself rather than get anyone else involved the matter"
" the request for attorney, the interrogator may suggest that the subject save himself his family the expense any such professional service, particularly innocent the offense under investigation"
" The interrogator may also add, `Joe, I'm only looking for the truth, and you're telling the truth, that's it"
 You can handle this yourself
"From these representative samples interrogation techniques, the setting prescribed the manuals and observed practice becomes clear"
" essence, this: alone with the subject essential prevent distraction and deprive him any outside support"
 The aura confidence his guilt undermines his will resist
 merely confirms the preconceived story the police seek have him describe
" Patience and persistence, times relentless questioning, are employed"
" obtain confession, the interrogator must ""patiently maneuver himself his quarry into position from which the desired objective may attained"
""" When normal procedures fail produce the needed result, the police may resort deceptive stratagems such giving false legal advice"
" important keep the subject off balance, for example, trading his insecurity about himself his surroundings"
" The police then persuade, trick, cajole him out exercising his constitutional rights"
" Even without employing brutality, the ""third degree"" the specific stratagems described above, the very fact custodial interrogation exacts heavy toll individual liberty and trades the weakness individuals"
This fact may illustrated simply referring three confession cases decided this Court the Term immediately preceding our Escobedo decision
" Townsend Sain, the defendant was 19-year-old heroin addict, described ""near mental defective"
" The defendant Lynumn Illinois,  was woman who confessed the arresting officer after being importuned ""cooperate"" order prevent her children from being taken relief authorities"
" This Court those cases reversed the conviction defendant Haynes Washington,  whose persistent request during his interrogation was phone his wife attorney"
" other settings, these individuals might have exercised their constitutional rights"
" the incommunicado police-dominated atmosphere, they succumbed"
" the cases before today, given this background, concern ourselves primarily with this interrogation atmosphere and the evils can bring"
"Miranda Arizona, the police arrested the defendant and took him special interrogation room where they secured confession"
" Vignera New York, the defendant made oral admissions the police after interrogation the afternoon, and then signed inculpatory statement upon being questioned assistant district attorney later the same evening"
"Westover United States, the defendant was handed over the Federal Bureau Investigation local authorities after they had detained and interrogated him for lengthy period, both night and the following morning"
" After some two hours questioning, the federal officers had obtained signed statements from the defendant"
"California Stewart, the local police held the defendant five days the station and interrogated him nine separate occasions before they secured his inculpatory statement"
" these cases, might not find the defendants' statements have been involuntary traditional terms"
" Our concern for adequate safeguards protect precious Fifth Amendment rights is, course, not lessened the slightest"
" each the cases, the defendant was thrust into unfamiliar atmosphere and run through menacing police interrogation procedures"
" The potentiality for compulsion forcefully apparent, for example, Miranda, where the indigent Mexican defendant was seriously disturbed individual with pronounced sexual fantasies, and Stewart, which the defendant was indigent Los Angeles Negro who had dropped out school the sixth grade"
" sure, the records not evince overt physical coercion patent psychological ploys"
 The fact remains that none these cases did the officers undertake afford appropriate safeguards the outset the interrogation insure that the statements were truly the product free choice
 obvious that such interrogation environment created for purpose other than subjugate the individual the will his examiner
 This atmosphere carries its own badge intimidation
" sure, this not physical intimidation, but equally destructive human dignity"
 The current practice incommunicado interrogation odds with one our Nation's most cherished principles that the individual may not compelled incriminate himself
" Unless adequate protective devices are employed dispel the compulsion inherent custodial surroundings, statement obtained from the defendant can truly the product his free choice"
" From the foregoing, can readily perceive intimate connection between the privilege against self-incrimination and police custodial questioning"
 fitting turn history and precedent underlying the Self-Incrimination Clause determine its applicability this situation
" sometimes forget how long has taken establish the privilege against self-incrimination, the sources from which came and the fervor with which was defended"
 Its roots back into ancient times
" Perhaps the critical historical event shedding light its origins and evolution was the trial one John Lilburn, vocal anti-Stuart Leveller, who was made take the Star Chamber Oath 1637"
 The oath would have bound him answer all questions posed him any subject
" The Trial John Lilburn and John Wharton, How resisted the oath and declaimed the proceedings, stating: ""Another fundamental right then contended for, was, that man's conscience ought racked oaths imposed, answer questions concerning himself matters criminal, pretended so"
""" Haller Davies, The Leveller Tracts 1647-1653, 454 (1944)"
" account the Lilburn Trial, Parliament abolished the inquisitorial Court Star Chamber and went further giving him generous reparation"
 The lofty principles which Lilburn had appealed during his trial gained popular acceptance England
 These sentiments worked their way over the Colonies and were implanted after great struggle into the Bill Rights
 Those who framed our Constitution and the Bill Rights were ever aware subtle encroachments individual liberty
" They knew that ""illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes procedure"
" The privilege was elevated constitutional status and has always been ""as broad the mischief cannot depart from this noble heritage"
 Thus may view the historical development the privilege one which groped for the proper scope governmental power over the citizen
" ""noble principle often transcends its origins,"" the privilege has come rightfully recognized part individual's substantive right, ""right private enclave where may lead private life"
 That right the hallmark our democracy
""" United States Grunewald, have recently noted that the privilege against self-incrimination the essential mainstay our adversary system founded complex values, Murphy Waterfront Comm'n"
 All these policies point one overriding thought: the constitutional foundation underlying the privilege the respect government state federal must accord the dignity and integrity its citizens
" maintain ""fair state-individual balance,"" require the government ""to shoulder the entire load,"" Wigmore, Evidence 317 (McNaughton rev"
" 1961), respect the inviolability the human personality, our accusatory system criminal justice demands that the government seeking punish individual produce the evidence against him its own independent labors, rather than the cruel, simple expedient compelling from his own mouth"
" sum, the privilege fulfilled only when the person guaranteed the right ""to remain silent unless chooses speak the unfettered exercise his own will"
 The question these cases whether the privilege fully applicable during period custodial interrogation
"this Court, the privilege has consistently been accorded liberal construction"
 are satisfied that all the principles embodied the privilege apply informal compulsion exerted law-enforcement officers during in-custody questioning
" individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded antagonistic forces, and subjected the techniques persuasion described above cannot otherwise than under compulsion speak"
" practical matter, the compulsion speak the isolated setting the police station may well greater than courts other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers guard against intimidation trickery"
" This question, fact, could have been taken settled federal courts almost years ago, when, Bram United States, this Court held: ""In criminal trials, the courts the United States, wherever question arises whether confession incompetent because not voluntary, the issue controlled that portion the Fifth Amendment commanding that person `shall compelled any criminal case witness against himself"
""" Bram, the Court reviewed the British and American history and case law and set down the Fifth Amendment standard for compulsion which implement today: ""Much the confusion which has resulted from the effort deduce from the adjudged cases what would sufficient quantum proof show that confession was not voluntary, has arisen from misconception the subject which the proof must address itself"
" The rule not that order render statement admissible the proof must adequate establish that the particular communications contained statement were voluntarily made, but must sufficient establish that the making the statement was voluntary; that say, that from the causes, which the law treats legally sufficient engender the mind the accused hope fear respect the crime charged, the accused was not involuntarily impelled make statement, when but for the improper influences would have remained silent"
" Justice Brandeis wrote for unanimous Court reversing conviction resting compelled confession, Wan United States stated: ""In the federal courts, the requisite voluntariness not satisfied establishing merely that the confession was not induced promise threat"
" confession voluntary law if, and only if, was, fact, voluntarily made"
" confession may have been given voluntarily, although was made police officers, while custody, and answer examination conducted them"
" But confession obtained compulsion must excluded whatever may have been the character the compulsion, and whether the compulsion was applied judicial proceeding otherwise"
" addition the expansive historical development the privilege and the sound policies which have nurtured its evolution, judicial precedent thus clearly establishes its application incommunicado interrogation"
" fact, the Government concedes this point well established"
"Westover United States, stating: ""We have doubt that possible for suspect's Fifth Amendment right violated during in-custody questioning law-enforcement officer"
""" Because the adoption Congress Rule (a) the Federal Rules Criminal Procedure, and this Court's effectuation that Rule McNabb United States, and Mallory United States, have had little occasion the past quarter century reach the constitutional issues dealing with federal interrogations"
" These supervisory rules, requiring production arrested person before commissioner ""without unnecessary delay"" and excluding evidence obtained default that statutory obligation, were nonetheless responsive the same considerations Fifth Amendment policy that unavoidably face now the States"
 McNabb and Mallory recognized both the dangers interrogation and the appropriateness prophylaxis stemming from the very fact interrogation itself
" Our decision Malloy Hogan, necessitates examination the scope the privilege state cases well"
" Malloy, squarely held the  privilege applicable the States, and held that the substantive standards underlying the privilege applied with full force state court proceedings"
" There, Murphy Waterfront Comm'n, and Griffin California applied the existing Fifth Amendment standards the case before us"
" Aside from the holding itself, the reasoning Malloy made clear what had already become apparent that the substantive and procedural safeguards surrounding admissibility confessions state cases had become exceedingly exacting, reflecting all the policies embedded the privilege, 378 U"
" The voluntariness doctrine the state cases, Malloy indicates, encompasses all interrogation practices which are likely exert such pressure upon individual disable him from making free and rational choice"
" The implications this proposition were elaborated our decision Escobedo Illinois, decided one week after Malloy applied the privilege the States"
" Our holding there stressed the fact that the police had not advised the defendant his constitutional privilege remain silent the outset the interrogation, and drew attention that fact several points the decision"
" This was isolated factor, but essential ingredient our decision"
" The entire thrust police interrogation there, all the cases today, was put the defendant such emotional state impair his capacity for rational judgment"
" The abdication the constitutional privilege the choice his part speak the police was not made knowingly competently because the failure apprise him his rights; the compelling atmosphere the in-custody interrogation, and not independent decision his part, caused the defendant speak"
 different phase the Escobedo decision was significant its attention the absence counsel during the questioning
" There, the cases today, sought protective device dispel the compelling atmosphere the interrogation"
" Escobedo, however, the police did not relieve the defendant the anxieties which they had created the interrogation rooms"
" Rather, they denied his request for the assistance counsel"
" This heightened his dilemma, and made his later statements the product this compulsion"
" The denial the defendant's request for his attorney thus undermined his ability exercise the privilege remain silent chose speak without any intimidation, blatant subtle"
" The presence counsel, all the cases before today, would the adequate protective device necessary make the process police interrogation conform the dictates the privilege"
 His presence would insure that statements made the government-established atmosphere are not the product compulsion
" was this manner that Escobedo explicated another facet the pre-trial privilege, noted many the Court's prior decisions: the protection rights trial"
 That counsel present when statements are taken from individual during interrogation obviously enhances the integrity the fact-finding processes court
" The presence attorney, and the warnings delivered the individual, enable the defendant under otherwise compelling circumstances tell his story without fear, effectively, and way that eliminates the evils the interrogation process"
" Without the protections flowing from adequate warnings and the rights counsel, ""all the careful safeguards erected around the giving testimony, whether accused any other witness, would become empty formalities procedure where the most compelling possible evidence guilt, confession, would have already been obtained the unsupervised pleasure the police"
" Today, then, there can doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege available outside criminal court proceedings and serves protect persons all settings which their freedom action curtailed any significant way from being compelled incriminate themselves"
 have concluded that without proper safeguards the process in-custody interrogation persons suspected accused crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work undermine the individual's will resist and compel him speak where would not otherwise freely
" order combat these pressures and permit full opportunity exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused must adequately and effectively apprised his rights and the exercise those rights must fully honored"
 impossible for foresee the potential alternatives for protecting the privilege which might devised Congress the States the exercise their creative rule-making capacities
 Therefore cannot say that the Constitution necessarily requires adherence any particular solution for the inherent compulsions the interrogation process presently conducted
" Our decision way creates constitutional straitjacket which will handicap sound efforts reform, nor intended have this effect"
 encourage Congress and the States continue their laudable search for increasingly effective ways protecting the rights the individual while promoting efficient enforcement our criminal laws
" However, unless are shown other procedures which are least effective apprising accused persons their right silence and assuring continuous opportunity exercise it, the following safeguards must observed"
" the outset, person custody subjected interrogation, must first informed clear and unequivocal terms that has the right remain silent"
" For those unaware the privilege, the warning needed simply make them aware the threshold requirement for intelligent decision its exercise"
" More important, such warning absolute prerequisite overcoming the inherent pressures the interrogation atmosphere"
" not just the subnormal woefully ignorant who succumb interrogator's imprecations, whether implied expressly stated, that the interrogation will continue until confession obtained that silence the face accusation itself damning and will bode ill when presented jury"
" Further, the warning will show the individual that his interrogators are prepared recognize his privilege should choose exercise it"
" The Fifth Amendment privilege fundamental our system constitutional rule and the expedient giving adequate warning the availability the privilege simple, will not pause inquire individual cases whether the defendant was aware his rights without warning being given"
" Assessments the knowledge the defendant possessed, based information his age, education, intelligence, prior contact with authorities, can never more than speculation; warning clearcut fact"
" More important, whatever the background the person interrogated, warning the time the interrogation indispensable overcome its pressures and insure that the individual knows free exercise the privilege that point time"
 The warning the right remain silent must accompanied the explanation that anything said can and will used against the individual court
" This warning needed order make him aware not only the privilege, but also the consequences forgoing it"
 only through awareness these consequences that there can any assurance real understanding and intelligent exercise the privilege
" Moreover, this warning may serve make the individual more acutely aware that faced with phase the adversary system that not the presence persons acting solely his interest"
 The circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly overbear the will one merely made aware his privilege his interrogators
" Therefore, the right have counsel present the interrogation indispensable the protection the Fifth Amendment privilege under the system delineate today"
 Our aim assure that the individual's right choose between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process
" once-stated warning, delivered those who will conduct the interrogation, cannot itself suffice that end among those who most require knowledge their rights"

""" Brief for the National District Attorneys Association amicus curiae, 14"
 Even preliminary advice given the accused his own attorney can swiftly overcome the secret interrogation process
"Thus, the need for counsel protect the Fifth Amendment privilege comprehends not merely right consult with counsel prior questioning, but also have counsel present during any questioning the defendant desires"
 The presence counsel the interrogation may serve several significant subsidiary functions well
" the accused decides talk his interrogators, the assistance counsel can mitigate the dangers untrustworthiness"
" With lawyer present the likelihood that the police will practice coercion reduced, and coercion nevertheless exercised the lawyer can testify court"
 The presence lawyer can also help guarantee that the accused gives fully accurate statement the police and that the statement rightly reported the prosecution trial
 individual need not make pre-interrogation request for lawyer
" While such request affirmatively secures his right have one, his failure ask for lawyer does not constitute waiver"
 effective waiver the right counsel during interrogation can recognized unless specifically made after the warnings here delineate have been given
 The accused who does not know his rights and therefore does not make request may the person who most needs counsel
" the California Supreme Court has aptly put it: ""Finally, must recognize that the imposition the requirement for the request would discriminate against the defendant who does not know his rights"
 The defendant who does not ask for counsel the very defendant who most needs counsel
" cannot penalize defendant who, not understanding his constitutional rights, does not make the formal request and such failure demonstrates his helplessness"
 require the request would favor the defendant whose sophistication status had fortuitously prompted him make it
"stated: ""[I]t settled that where the assistance counsel constitutional requisite, the right furnished counsel does not depend request"
""" This proposition applies with equal force the context providing counsel protect accused's Fifth Amendment privilege the face interrogation"
" Although the role counsel trial differs from the role during interrogation, the differences are not relevant the question whether request prerequisite"
 Accordingly hold that individual held for interrogation must clearly informed that has the right consult with lawyer and have the lawyer with him during interrogation under the system for protecting the privilege delineate today
" with the warnings the right remain silent and that anything stated can used evidence against him, this warning absolute prerequisite interrogation"
 amount circumstantial evidence that the person may have been aware this right will suffice stand its stead: Only through such warning there ascertainable assurance that the accused was aware this right
S
" individual indicates that wishes the assistance counsel before any interrogation occurs, the authorities cannot rationally ignore deny his request the basis that the individual does not have cannot afford retained attorney"
 The financial ability the individual has relationship the scope the rights involved here
 The privilege against self-incrimination secured the Constitution applies all individuals
 The need for counsel order protect the privilege exists for the indigent well the affluent
" fact, were limit these constitutional rights those who can retain attorney, our decisions today would little significance"
 The cases before well the vast majority confession cases with which have dealt the past involve those unable retain counsel
" While authorities are not required relieve the accused his poverty, they have the obligation not take advantage indigence the administration justice"
" Denial counsel the indigent the time interrogation while allowing attorney those who can afford one would more supportable reason logic than the similar situation trial and appeal struck down Gideon Wainwright, and Douglas California ,order fully apprise person interrogated the extent his rights under this system then, necessary warn him not only that has the right consult with attorney, but also that indigent lawyer will appointed represent him"
" Without this additional warning, the admonition the right consult with counsel would often understood meaning only that can consult with lawyer has one has the funds obtain one"
 The warning right counsel would hollow not couched terms that would convey the indigent the person most often subjected interrogation the knowledge that too has right have counsel present
" with the warnings the right remain silent and the general right counsel, only effective and express explanation the indigent this right can there assurance that was truly position exercise it"
" Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure clear"
" the individual indicates any manner, any time prior during questioning, that wishes remain silent, the interrogation must cease"
" this point has shown that intends exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot other than the product compulsion, subtle otherwise"
" Without the right cut off questioning, the setting in-custody interrogation operates the individual overcome free choice producing statement after the privilege has been once invoked"
" the individual states that wants attorney, the interrogation must cease until attorney present"
" that time, the individual must have opportunity confer with the attorney and have him present during any subsequent questioning"
" the individual cannot obtain attorney and indicates that wants one before speaking police, they must respect his decision remain silent"
" This does not mean, some have suggested, that each police station must have ""station house lawyer"" present all times advise prisoners"
" does mean, however, that police propose interrogate person they must make known him that entitled lawyer and that cannot afford one, lawyer will provided for him prior any interrogation"
" authorities conclude that they will not provide counsel during reasonable period time which investigation the field carried out, they may refrain from doing without violating the person's Fifth Amendment privilege long they not question him during that time"
"the interrogation continues without the presence attorney and statement taken, heavy burden rests the government demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right retained appointed counsel"
" This Court has always set high standards proof for the waiver constitutional rights, Johnson Zerbst, and re-assert these standards applied in-custody interrogation"
" Since the State responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances under which the interrogation takes place and has the only means making available corroborated evidence warnings given during incommunicado interrogation, the burden rightly its shoulders"
 express statement that the individual willing make statement and does not want attorney followed closely statement could constitute waiver
 But valid waiver will not presumed simply from the silence the accused after warnings are given simply from the fact that confession was fact eventually obtained
" statement made Carnley Cochran, applicable here: ""Presuming waiver from silent record impermissible"
" The record must show, there must allegation and evidence which show, that accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer"
 Anything less not waiver
" Moreover, where in-custody interrogation involved, there room for the contention that the privilege waived the individual answers some questions gives some information his own prior invoking his right remain silent when interrogated"
" Whatever the testimony the authorities waiver rights accused, the fact lengthy interrogation incommunicado incarceration before statement made strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his rights"
 these circumstances the fact that the individual eventually made statement consistent with the conclusion that the compelling influence the interrogation finally forced him so
 inconsistent with any notion voluntary relinquishment the privilege
" Moreover, any evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, cajoled into waiver will, course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege"
 The requirement warnings and waiver rights fundamental with respect the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply preliminary ritual existing methods interrogation
" The warnings required and the waiver necessary accordance with our opinion today are, the absence fully effective equivalent, prerequisites the admissibility any statement made defendant"
" distinction can drawn between statements which are direct confessions and statements which amount ""admissions"" part all offense"
 The privilege against self-incrimination protects the individual from being compelled incriminate himself any manner; does not distinguish degrees incrimination
" Similarly, for precisely the same reason, distinction may drawn between inculpatory statements and statements alleged merely ""exculpatory"
""" statement made were fact truly exculpatory would, course, never used the prosecution"
" fact, statements merely intended exculpatory the defendant are often used impeach his testimony trial demonstrate untruths the statement given under interrogation and thus prove guilt implication"
 These statements are incriminating any meaningful sense the word and may not used without the full warnings and effective waiver required for any other statement
" Escobedo itself, the defendant fully intended his accusation another the slayer exculpatory himself"
 The principles announced today deal with the protection which must given the privilege against self-incrimination when the individual first subjected police interrogation while custody the station otherwise deprived his freedom action any significant way
" this point that our adversary system criminal proceedings commences, distinguishing itself the outset from the inquisitorial system recognized some countries"
" Under the system warnings delineate today under any other system which may devised and found effective, the safeguards erected about the privilege must come into play this point"
 Our decision not intended hamper the traditional function police officers investigating crime
" See Escobedo Illinois, When individual custody probable cause, the police may, course, seek out evidence the field used trial against him"
 Such investigation may include inquiry persons not under restraint
 General on-the-scene questioning facts surrounding crime other general questioning citizens the fact-finding process not affected our holding responsible citizenship for individuals give whatever information they may have aid law enforcement
 such situations the compelling atmosphere inherent the process in-custody interrogation not necessarily present
" dealing with statements obtained through interrogation, not purport find all confessions inadmissible"
 Confessions remain proper element law enforcement
" Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, course, admissible evidence"
" The fundamental import the privilege while individual custody not whether allowed talk the police without the benefit warnings and counsel, but whether can interrogated"
" There requirement that police stop person who enters police station and states that wishes confess crime, person who calls the police offer confession any other statement desires make"
 Volunteered statements any kind are not barred the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility not affected our holding today
" summarize, hold that when individual taken into custody otherwise deprived his freedom the authorities any significant way and subjected questioning, the privilege against self-incrimination jeopardized"
" Procedural safeguards must employed protect the privilege, and unless other fully effective means are adopted notify the person his right silence and assure that the exercise the right will scrupulously honored, the following measures are required"
" must warned prior any questioning that has the right remain silent, that anything says can used against him court law, that has the right the presence attorney, and that cannot afford attorney one will appointed for him prior any questioning desires"
 Opportunity exercise these rights must afforded him throughout the interrogation
" After such warnings have been given, and such opportunity afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree answer questions make statement"
" But unless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated the prosecution trial, evidence obtained result interrogation can used against him"
 recurrent argument made these cases that society's need for interrogation outweighs the privilege
 This argument not unfamiliar this Court
 The whole thrust our foregoing discussion demonstrates that the Constitution has prescribed the rights the individual when confronted with the power government when provided the Fifth Amendment that individual cannot compelled witness against himself
 That right cannot abridged
" Mr Justice Brandeis once observed: ""Decency, security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall subjected the same rules conduct that are commands the citizen"
" government laws, existence the government will imperilled fails observe the law scrupulously"
" Our Government the potent, the omnipresent teacher"
" For good for ill, teaches the whole people its example"
 Crime contagious
" the Government becomes lawbreaker, breeds contempt for law; invites every man become law unto himself; invites anarchy"
 declare that the administration the criminal law the end justifies the means would bring terrible retribution
 Against that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face
" this connection, one our country's distinguished jurists has pointed out: ""The quality nation's civilization can largely measured the methods uses the enforcement its criminal law"
""" the individual desires exercise his privilege, has the right so"
 This not for the authorities decide
" attorney may advise his client not talk police until has had opportunity investigate the case, may wish present with his client during any police questioning"
 doing attorney merely exercising the good professional judgment has been taught
 This not cause for considering the attorney menace law enforcement
 merely carrying out what sworn under his oath protect the extent his ability the rights his client
 fulfilling this responsibility the attorney plays vital role the administration criminal justice under our Constitution
" announcing these principles, are not unmindful the burdens which law enforcement officials must bear, often under trying circumstances"
 also fully recognize the obligation all citizens aid enforcing the criminal laws
" This Court, while protecting individual rights, has always given ample latitude law enforcement agencies the legitimate exercise their duties"
 The limits have placed the interrogation process should not constitute undue interference with proper system law enforcement
" have noted, our decision does not any way preclude police from carrying out their traditional investigatory functions"
" Although confessions may play important role some convictions, the cases before present graphic examples the overstatement the ""need"" for confessions"
" each case authorities conducted interrogations ranging five days duration despite the presence, through standard investigating practices, considerable evidence against each defendant"
also urged that unfettered right detention for interrogation should allowed because will often redound the benefit the person questioned
" When police inquiry determines that there reason believe that the person has committed any crime, said, will released without need for further formal procedures"
" The person who has committed offense, however, will better able clear himself after warnings with counsel present than without"
 can assumed that such circumstances lawyer would advise his client talk freely police order clear himself
" Custodial interrogation, contrast, does not necessarily afford the innocent opportunity clear themselves"
" serious consequence the present practice the interrogation alleged beneficial for the innocent that many arrests ""for investigation"" subject large numbers innocent persons detention and interrogation"
" one the cases before us, "
" California Stewart, police held four persons, who were the defendant's house the time the arrest, jail for five days until defendant confessed"
 that time they were finally released
" Police stated that there was ""no evidence connect them with any crime"
""" Available statistics the extent this practice where condoned indicate that these four are far from alone being subjected arrest, prolonged detention, and interrogation without the requisite probable cause"
"Over the years the Federal Bureau Investigation has compiled exemplary record effective law enforcement while advising any suspect arrested person, the outset interview, that not required make statement, that any statement may used against him court, that the individual may obtain the services attorney his own choice and, more recently, that has right free counsel unable pay"
" letter received from the Solicitor General response question from the Bench makes clear that the present pattern warnings and respect for the rights the individual followed practice the FBI consistent with the procedure which delineate today states: ""At the oral argument the above cause, Mr"
 Justice Fortas asked whether could provide certain information the practices followed the Federal Bureau Investigation
 have directed these questions the attention the Director the Federal Bureau Investigation and submitting herewith statement the questions and the answers which have received
" ""`(1) When individual interviewed agents the Bureau, what warning given him? ""`The standard warning long given Special Agents the FBI both suspects and persons under arrest that the person has right say nothing and right counsel, and that any statement does make may used against him court"
"""`After passage the Criminal Justice Act 1964, which provides free counsel for Federal defendants unable pay, added our instructions Special Agents the requirement that any person who under arrest for offense under FBI jurisdiction, whose arrest contemplated following the interview, must also advised his right free counsel unable pay, and the fact that such counsel will assigned the Judge"
" the same time, broadened the right counsel warning read counsel his own choice, anyone else with whom might wish speak"
" ""`(2) When the warning given? ""`The FBI warning given suspect the very outset the interview, shown the Westover case, cited above"
" The warning may given person arrested soon practicable after the arrest, shown the Jackson case, also cited above, but any event must precede the interview with the person for confession admission his own guilt"
" ""`(3) What the Bureau's practice the event that (a) the individual requests counsel and (b) counsel appears? ""`When the person who has been warned his right counsel decides that wishes consult with counsel before making statement, the interview terminated that point, Shultz U"
" may continued, however, all matters other than the person's own guilt innocence"
" indecisive his request for counsel, there may some question whether did did not waive counsel"
 Situations this kind must necessarily left the judgment the interviewing Agent
the Agent's conclusion that the person arrested had waived his right counsel was upheld the courts
" ""`A person being interviewed and desiring consult counsel telephone must permitted so, shown Caldwell U"
" When counsel appears person, permitted confer with his client private"
" ""`(4) What the Bureau's practice the individual requests counsel, but cannot afford retain attorney? ""`If any person being interviewed after warning counsel decides that wishes consult with counsel before proceeding further the interview terminated, shown above"
 FBI Agents not pass judgment the ability the person pay for counsel
" They do, however, advise those who have been arrested for offense under FBI jurisdiction, whose arrest contemplated following the interview, right free counsel they are unable pay, and the availability such counsel from the Judge"
"'"" The practice the FBI can readily emulated state and local enforcement agencies"
 The argument that the FBI deals with different crimes than are dealt with state authorities does not mitigate the significance the FBI experience
 The experience some other countries also suggests that the danger law enforcement curbs interrogation overplayed
 The English procedure since 1912 under the Judges' Rules significant
"recently strengthened, the Rules require that cautionary warning given accused police officer soon has evidence that affords reasonable grounds for suspicion; they also require that any statement made given the accused without questioning police"
The right the individual consult with attorney during this period expressly recognized
 The safeguards present under Scottish law may even greater than England
 Scottish judicial decisions bar use evidence most confessions obtained through police interrogation
" India, confessions made police not the presence magistrate have been excluded rule evidence since 1872, time when operated under British law"
" Identical provisions appear the Evidence Ordinance Ceylon, enacted 1895"
" Similarly, our country the Uniform Code Military Justice has long provided that suspect may interrogated without first being warned his right not make statement and that any statement makes may used against him"
 Denial the right consult counsel during interrogation has also been proscribed military tribunals
 There appears have been marked detrimental effect criminal law enforcement these jurisdictions result these rules
 Conditions law enforcement our country are sufficiently similar permit reference this experience assurance that lawlessness will not result from warning individual his rights allowing him exercise them
" Moreover, consistent with our legal system that give least much protection these rights given the jurisdictions described"
" deal our country with rights grounded specific requirement the Fifth Amendment the Constitution, whereas other jurisdictions arrived their conclusions the basis principles justice not specifically defined"
 also urged upon that withhold decision this issue until state legislative bodies and advisory groups have had opportunity deal with these problems rule making
 have already pointed out that the Constitution does not require any specific code procedures for protecting the privilege against self-incrimination during custodial interrogation
" Congress and the States are free develop their own safeguards for the privilege, long they are fully effective those described above informing accused persons their right silence and affording continuous opportunity exercise it"
" any event, however, the issues presented are constitutional dimensions and must determined the courts"
 The admissibility statement the face claim that was obtained violation the defendant's constitutional rights issue the resolution which has long since been undertaken this Court
 Judicial solutions problems constitutional dimension have evolved decade decade
" courts have been presented with the need enforce constitutional rights, they have found means doing so"
 That was our responsibility when Escobedo was before and our responsibility today
" Where rights secured the Constitution are involved, there can rule making legislation which would abrogate them"
" Because the nature the problem and because its recurrent significance numerous cases, have this point discussed the relationship the Fifth Amendment privilege police interrogation without specific concentration the facts the cases before us"
 turn now these facts consider the application these cases the constitutional principles discussed above
" each instance, have concluded that statements were obtained from the defendant under circumstances that did not meet constitutional standards for protection the privilege"
 Miranda Arizona
" March 13, 1963, petitioner, Ernesto Miranda, was arrested his home and taken custody Phoenix police station"
 was there identified the complaining witness
" The police then took him ""Interrogation Room No"
 the detective bureau
 There was questioned two police officers
 The officers admitted trial that Miranda was not advised that had right have attorney present
" Two hours later, the officers emerged from the interrogation room with written confession signed Miranda"
" the top the statement was typed paragraph stating that the confession was made voluntarily, without threats promises immunity and ""with full knowledge legal rights, understanding any statement make may used against me"
""" his trial before jury, the written confession was admitted into evidence over the objection defense counsel, and the officers testified the prior oral confession made Miranda during the interrogation"
 Miranda was found guilty kidnapping and rape
" was sentenced years' imprisonment each count, the sentences run concurrently"
" appeal, the Supreme Court Arizona held that Miranda's constitutional rights were not violated obtaining the confession and affirmed the conviction"
" reaching its decision, the court emphasized heavily the fact that Miranda did not specifically request counsel"
 reverse
" From the testimony the officers and the admission respondent, clear that Miranda was not any way apprised his right consult with attorney and have one present during the interrogation, nor was his right not compelled incriminate himself effectively protected any other manner"
 Without these warnings the statements were inadmissible
" The mere fact that signed statement which contained typed-in clause stating that had ""full knowledge"" his ""legal rights"" does not approach the knowing and intelligent waiver required relinquish constitutional rights"
 Vignera New York
" Petitioner, Michael Vignera, was picked New York police October 14, 1960, connection with the robbery three days earlier Brooklyn dress shop"
 They took him the 17th Detective Squad headquarters Manhattan
 Sometime thereafter was taken the 66th Detective Squad
 There detective questioned Vignera with respect the robbery
 Vignera orally admitted the robbery the detective
 The detective was asked cross-examination trial defense counsel whether Vignera was warned his right counsel before being interrogated
 The prosecution objected the question and the trial judge sustained the objection
" Thus, the defense was precluded from making any showing that warnings had not been given"
" While the 66th Detective Squad, Vignera was identified the store owner and saleslady the man who robbed the dress shop"
 about was formally arrested
" The police then transported him still another station, the 70th Precinct Brooklyn, ""for detention"
""" Vignera was questioned assistant district attorney the presence hearing reporter who transcribed the questions and Vignera's answers"
 This verbatim account these proceedings contains statement any warnings given the assistant district attorney
" Vignera's trial charge first degree robbery, the detective testified the oral confession"
 The transcription the statement taken was also introduced evidence
" the conclusion the testimony, the trial judge charged the jury part follows: ""The law doesn't say that the confession void invalidated because the police officer didn't advise the defendant his rights"
 Did you hear what I said? telling you what the law the State New York is
""" Vignera was found guilty first degree robbery"
 was subsequently adjudged third-felony offender and sentenced years' imprisonment
" The conviction was affirmed without opinion the Appellate Division, Second Department, App"
" argument the Court Appeals, the State contended that Vignera had constitutional right advised his right counsel his privilege against self-incrimination"
 reverse
 The foregoing indicates that Vignera was not warned any his rights before the questioning the detective and the assistant district attorney
 other steps were taken protect these rights
 Thus was not effectively apprised his Fifth Amendment privilege his right have counsel present and his statements are inadmissible
 Westover United States
" approximately 9:45 March 20, 1963, petitioner, Carl Calvin Westover, was arrested local police Kansas City suspect two Kansas City robberies"
 report was also received from the FBI that was wanted felony charge California
" The local authorities took him police station and placed him line-up the local charges, and about 11:45 was booked"
 Kansas City police interrogated Westover  the night his arrest
 denied any knowledge criminal activities
 The next day local officers interrogated him again throughout the morning
 Shortly before noon they informed the FBI that they were through interrogating Westover and that the FBI could proceed interrogate him
 There nothing the record indicate that Westover was ever given any warning his rights local police
" noon, three special agents the FBI continued the interrogation private interview room the Kansas City Police Department, this time with respect the robbery savings and loan association and bank Sacramento, California"
" After two two and one-half hours, Westover signed separate confessions each these two robberies which had been prepared one the agents during the interrogation"
" trial one the agents testified, and paragraph each the statements states, that the agents advised Westover that did not have make statement, that any statement made could used against him, and that had the right see attorney"
 Westover was tried jury federal court and convicted the California robberies
 His statements were introduced trial
" was sentenced years' imprisonment each count, the sentences run consecutively"
" appeal, the conviction was affirmed the Court Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"
 reverse
 the facts this case cannot find that Westover knowingly and intelligently waived his right remain silent and his right consult with counsel prior the time made the statement
"the time the FBI agents began questioning Westover, had been custody for over hours and had been interrogated length during that period"
 The FBI interrogation began immediately upon the conclusion the interrogation Kansas City police and was conducted local police headquarters
" Although the two law enforcement authorities are legally distinct and the crimes for which they interrogated Westover were different, the impact him was that continuous period questioning"
 There evidence any warning given prior the FBI interrogation nor there any evidence articulated waiver rights after the FBI commenced its interrogation
 The record simply shows that the defendant did fact confess short time after being turned over the FBI following interrogation local police
" Despite the fact that the FBI agents gave warnings the outset their interview, from Westover's point view the warnings came the end the interrogation process"
 these circumstances intelligent waiver constitutional rights cannot assumed
 not suggest that law enforcement authorities are precluded from questioning any individual who has been held for period time other authorities and interrogated them without appropriate warnings
" different case would presented accused were taken into custody the second authority, removed both time and place from his original surroundings, and then adequately advised his rights and given opportunity exercise them"
 But here the FBI interrogation was conducted immediately following the state interrogation the same police station the same compelling surroundings
" Thus, obtaining confession from Westover the federal authorities were the beneficiaries the pressure applied the local in-custody interrogation"
 these circumstances the giving warnings alone was not sufficient protect the privilege

 about 7:15 m
" January 31, 1963, police officers went Stewart's house and arrested him"
" One the officers asked Stewart they could search the house, which replied, ""Go ahead"
""" The search turned various items taken from the five robbery victims"
" the time Stewart's arrest, police also arrested Stewart's wife and three other persons who were visiting him"
 These four were jailed along with Stewart and were interrogated
 Stewart was taken the University Station the Los Angeles Police Department where was placed cell
" During the next five days, police interrogated Stewart nine different occasions"
" Except during the first interrogation session, when was confronted with accusing witness, Stewart was isolated with his interrogators"
" During the ninth interrogation session, Stewart admitted that had robbed the deceased and stated that had not meant hurt her"
 Police then brought Stewart before magistrate for the first time
" Since there was evidence connect them with any crime, the police then released the other four persons arrested with him"
 Nothing the record specifically indicates whether Stewart was was not advised his right remain silent his right counsel
" number instances, however, the interrogating officers were asked recount everything that was said during the interrogations"
 None indicated that Stewart was ever advised his rights
" Stewart was charged with kidnapping commit robbery, rape, and murder"
" his trial, transcripts the first interrogation and the confession the last interrogation were introduced evidence"
 The jury found Stewart guilty robbery and first degree murder and fixed the penalty death
" appeal, the Supreme Court California reversed"
" held that under this Court's decision Escobedo, Stewart should have been advised his right remain silent and his right counsel and that would not presume the face silent record that the police advised Stewart his rights"
 affirm
" dealing with custodial interrogation, will not presume that defendant has been effectively apprised his rights and that his privilege against self-incrimination has been adequately safeguarded record that does not show that any warnings have been given that any effective alternative has been employed"
 Nor can knowing and intelligent waiver these rights assumed silent record
" Furthermore, Stewart's steadfast denial the alleged offenses through eight the nine interrogations over period five days subject other construction than that was compelled persistent interrogation forgo his Fifth Amendment privilege"
" Therefore, accordance with the foregoing, the judgments the Supreme Court Arizona No"
 The complex problems also prompted discussions jurists

 INTRODUCTION
" the outset, well note exactly what required the Court's new constitutional code rules for confessions"
" The foremost requirement, upon which later admissibility confession depends, that fourfold warning given person custody before questioned, namely, that has right remain silent, that anything says may used against him, that has right have present attorney during the questioning, and that indigent has right lawyer without charge"
" forgo these rights, some affirmative statement rejection seemingly required, and threats, tricks, cajolings obtain this waiver are forbidden"
" before during questioning the suspect seeks invoke his right remain silent, interrogation must forgone cease; request for counsel brings about the same result until lawyer procured"
" Finally, there are miscellany minor directives, for example, the burden proof waiver the State, admissions and exculpatory statements are treated just like confessions, withdrawal waiver always permitted, and forth"
" While the fine points this scheme are far less clear than the Court admits, the tenor quite apparent"
 The new rules are not designed guard against police brutality other unmistakably banned forms coercion
 Those who use third-degree tactics and deny them court are equally able and destined lie skillfully about warnings and waivers
" Rather, the thrust the new rules negate all pressures, reinforce the nervous ignorant suspect, and ultimately discourage any confession all"
" The aim short toward ""voluntariness"" utopian sense, view from different angle, voluntariness with vengeance"
 incorporate this notion into the Constitution requires strained reading history and precedent and disregard the very pragmatic concerns that alone may occasion justify such strains
" believe that reasoned examination will show that the Due Process Clauses provide adequate tool for coping with confessions and that, even the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination invoked, its precedents taken whole not sustain the present rules"
" Viewed choice based pure policy, these new rules prove highly debatable, not one-sided, appraisal the competing interests, imposed over widespread objection, the very time when judicial restraint most called for the circumstances"
 CONSTITUTIONAL PREMISES
 most fitting begin inquiry into the constitutional precedents surveying the limits confessions the Court has evolved under the Due Process Clause the Fourteenth Amendment
 This because these cases show that there exists workable and effective means dealing with confessions judicial manner; because the cases are the baseline from which the Court now departs and serve measure the actual opposed the professed distance travels; and because examination them helps reveal how the Court has coasted into its present position
" The earliest confession cases this Court emerged from federal prosecutions and were settled nonconstitutional basis, the Court adopting the common-law rule that the absence inducements, promises, and threats made confession voluntary and admissible"
"While later case said the Fifth Amendment privilege controlled admissibility, this proposition was not itself developed subsequent decisions"
" The Court did, however, heighten the test admissibility federal trials one voluntariness ""in fact,"" Wan [384 U"
 and then and large left federal judges apply the same standards the Court began derive string state court cases
" This new line decisions, testing admissibility the Due Process Clause, began 1936 with Brown Mississippi, 297 U"
and must now embrace somewhat more than full opinions the Court
 While the voluntariness rubric was repeated many instances
the Court never pinned down single meaning but the contrary infused with number different values
" travel quickly over the main themes, there was initial emphasis reliability"
"supplemented concern over the legality and fairness the police practices,"
"""accusatorial"" system law enforcement, Watts Indiana, and eventually close attention the individual's state mind and capacity for effective choice"
 The outcome was continuing re-evaluation the facts each case how much pressure the suspect was permissible
"Among the criteria often taken into account were threats imminent danger, g"
", Payne Arkansas, 356 U"
physical deprivations such lack sleep food
"Apart from direct physical coercion, however, single default fixed combination defaults guaranteed exclusion, and synopses the cases would serve little use because the overall gauge has been steadily changing, usually the direction restricting admissibility"
" But mark just what point had been reached before the Court jumped the rails Escobedo Illinois, worth capsulizing the then-recent case Haynes Washington,"
"There, Haynes had been held some more hours violation state law before signing the disputed confession, had received warnings any kind, and despite requests had been refused access his wife counsel, the police indicating that access would allowed after confession"
" Emphasizing especially this last inducement and rejecting some contrary indicia voluntariness, the Court 5-to-4 decision held the confession inadmissible"
 There are several relevant lessons drawn from this constitutional history
" The first that with over years precedent the Court has developed elaborate, sophisticated, and sensitive approach admissibility confessions"
" ""judicial"" its treatment one case time, see Culombe Connecticut, (concurring opinion THE CHIEF JUSTICE), flexible its ability respond the endless mutations fact presented, and ever more familiar the lower courts"
"course, strict certainty not obtained this developing process, but this often with constitutional principles, and disagreement usually confined that borderland close cases where matters least"
" The second point that practice and from time time principle, the Court has given ample recognition society's interest suspect questioning instrument law enforcement"
" Cases countenancing quite significant pressures can cited without difficulty, and the lower courts may often have been yet more tolerant"
" course the limitations imposed today were rejected necessary implication case after case, the right warnings having been explicitly rebuffed this Court many years ago"
"the Court openly acknowledged that questioning witnesses and suspects ""is undoubtedly essential tool effective law enforcement"
""" Accord, Crooker California, Finally, the cases disclose that the language many the opinions overstates the actual course decision has been said, for example, that admissible confession must made the suspect ""in the unfettered exercise his own will,"" Malloy Hogan,"
" and that prisoner not `to made the deluded instrument his own conviction,'"" Culombe Connecticut, announcing the Court's judgment and opinion)"
" Though often repeated, such principles are rarely observed full measure"
" Even the word ""voluntary"" may deemed somewhat isleading, especially when one considers many the confessions that have been brought under its umbrella"
", supra, The tendency overstate may laid part the flagrant facts often before the Court; but any event one must recognize how has tempered attitudes and lent some color authority the approach now taken the Court"
" turn now the Court's asserted reliance the Fifth Amendment, approach which frankly regard trompe l'oeil"
 The Court's opinion view reveals adequate basis for extending the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination the police station
" Far more important, fails show that the Court's new rules are well supported, let alone compelled, Fifth Amendment precedents"
" Instead, the new rules actually derive from quotation and analogy drawn from precedents under the Sixth Amendment, which should properly have bearing police interrogation"
" The Court's opening contention, that the Fifth Amendment governs police station confessions, perhaps not impermissible extension the law but has little commend itself the present circumstances"
" Historically, the privilege against self-incrimination did not bear all the use extra-legal confessions, for which distinct standards evolved; indeed, ""the history the two principles wide apart, differing one hundred years origin, and derived through separate lines precedents Wigmore, Evidence 2266, 401 (McNaughton rev"
 1961)
 Practice under the two doctrines has also differed number important respects
"Even those who would readily enlarge the privilege must concede some linguistic difficulties since the Fifth Amendment terms proscribes only compelling any person ""in any criminal case witness against himself"
" Kamisar, Equal Justice the Gatehouses and Mansions American Criminal Procedure, Criminal Justice Our Time 25-26 (1965)"
" Though weighty, not say these points and similar ones are conclusive, for, the Court reiterates, the privilege embodies basic principles always capable expansion"
" Certainly the privilege does represent protective concern for the accused and emphasis upon accusatorial rather than inquisitorial values law enforcement, although this similarly true other limitations such the grand jury requirement and the reasonable doubt standard"
" Accusatorial values, however, have openly been absorbed into the due process standard governing confessions; this indeed why present ""the kinship the two rules [governing confessions and self-incrimination] too apparent for denial"
""" McCormick, Evidence 155 (1954)"
" Since extension the general principle has already occurred, insist that the privilege applies such serves only carry over inapposite historical details and engaging rhetoric and obscure the policy choices made regulating confessions"
" Having decided that the Fifth Amendment privilege does apply the police station, the Court reveals that the privilege imposes more exacting restrictions than does the Fourteenth Amendment's voluntariness test"
"then emerges from discussion Escobedo that the Fifth Amendment requires for admissible confession that given one distinctly aware his right not speak and shielded from ""the compelling atmosphere"" interrogation"
" From these key premises, the Court finally develops the safeguards warning, counsel, and forth"
 not believe these premises are sustained precedents under the Fifth Amendment
 The more important premise that pressure the suspect must eliminated though only the subtle influence the atmosphere and surroundings
" The Fifth Amendment, however, has never been thought forbid all pressure incriminate one's self the situations covered it"
" the contrary, has been held that failure incriminate one's self can result denial removal one's case from state federal court, Maryland Soper, 270 U"
" refusal military commission, Orloff Willoughby,  denial discharge bankruptcy, Kaufman Hurwitz, and numerous other adverse consequences"
 This not say that short jail torture any sanction permissible any case; policy and history alike may impose sharp limits
"However, the Court's unspoken assumption that any pressure violates the privilege not supported the precedents and has failed show why the Fifth Amendment prohibits that relatively mild pressure the Due Process Clause permits"
 The Court appears similarly wrong thinking that precise knowledge one's rights settled prerequisite under the Fifth Amendment the loss its protections
" number lower federal court cases have held that grand jury witnesses need not always warned their privilege, g"
and Wigmore states this the better rule for trial witnesses
(waiver constitutional rights counsel despite defendant's ignorance held allowable)
 Fifth Amendment precedent cited for the Court's contrary view
 There might course reasons apart from Fifth Amendment precedent for requiring warning any other safeguard questioning but that different matter entirely
" closing word must said about the Assistance Counsel Clause the Sixth Amendment, which never expressly relied the Court but whose judicial precedents turn out linchpins the confession rules announced today"
" support its requirement knowing and intelligent waiver, the Court cites Johnson Zerbst"
 All these cases imparting glosses the Sixth Amendment concerned counsel trial appeal
" While the Court finds pertinent difference between judicial proceedings and police interrogation, believe the differences are vast disqualify wholly the Sixth Amendment precedents suitable analogies the present cases"
" The only attempt this Court carry the right counsel into the station house occurred Escobedo, the Court repeating several times that that stage was less ""critical"" than trial itself"
" This hardly persuasive when consider that grand jury inquiry, the filing certiorari petition, and certainly the purchase narcotics undercover agent from prospective defendant may all equally ""critical"" yet provision counsel and advice that score have never been thought compelled the Constitution such cases"
" The sound reason why this right freely extended for criminal trial the severe injustice risked confronting untrained defendant with range technical points law, evidence, and tactics familiar the prosecutor but not himself"
 This danger shrinks markedly the police station where indeed the lawyer fulfilling his professional responsibilities necessity may become obstacle truthfinding
" The Court's summary citation the Sixth Amendment cases here seems best described ""the domino method constitutional adjudication wherein every explanatory statement previous opinion made the basis for extension wholly different situation"
 POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
" Examined expression public policy, the Court's new regime proves dubious that there can due compensation for its weakness constitutional law"
" The foregoing discussion has shown, think, how mistaken the Court implying that the Constitution has struck the balance favor the approach the Court takes"
" Rather, precedent reveals that the Fourteenth Amendment practice has been construed strike different balance, that the Fifth Amendment gives the Court little solid support this context, and that the Sixth Amendment should have bearing all"
 Legal history has been stretched before satisfy deep needs society
" this instance, however, the Court has not and cannot make the powerful showing that its new rules are plainly desirable the context our society, something which surely demanded before those rules are engrafted onto the Constitution and imposed every State and county the land"
" Without all subscribing the generally black picture police conduct painted the Court, think must frankly recognized the outset that police questioning allowable under due process precedents may inherently entail some pressure the suspect and may seek advantage his ignorance weaknesses"
" The atmosphere and questioning techniques, proper and fair though they be, can themselves exert tug the suspect confess, and this light ""[t]o speak any confessions crime made after arrest being `voluntary' `uncoerced' somewhat inaccurate, although traditional"
 confession wholly and incontestably voluntary only guilty person gives himself the law and becomes his own accuser
" Until today, the role the Constitution has been only sift out undue pressure, not assure spontaneous confessions"
The Court's new rules aim offset these minor pressures and disadvantages intrinsic any kind police interrogation
" The rules not serve due process interests preventing blatant coercion since, noted earlier, they nothing contain the policeman who prepared lie from the start"
 The rules work for reliability confessions almost only the Pickwickian sense that they can prevent some from being given all
" short, the benefit this new regime simply lessen wipe out the inherent compulsion and inequalities which the Court devotes some nine pages description"
" What the Court largely ignores that its rules impair, they will not eventually serve wholly frustrate, instrument law enforcement that has long and quite reasonably been thought worth the price paid for it"
 There can little doubt that the Court's new code would markedly decrease the number confessions
 warn the suspect that may remain silent and remind him that his confession may used court are minor obstructions
 require also express waiver the suspect and end questioning whenever demurs must heavily handicap questioning
 And suggest provide counsel for the suspect simply invites the end the interrogation
 How much harm this decision will inflict law enforcement cannot fairly predicted with accuracy
" Evidence the role confessions notoriously incomplete, see Developments, supra, 941-944, and little added the Court's reference the FBI experience and the resources believed wasted interrogation"
" know that some crimes cannot solved without confessions, that ample expert testimony attests their importance crime control, and that the Court taking real risk with society's welfare imposing its new regime the country"
 The social costs crime are too great call the new rules anything but hazardous experimentation
" While passing over the costs and risks its experiment, the Court portrays the evils normal police questioning terms which think are exaggerated"
 Albeit stringently confined the due process standards interrogation doubt often inconvenient and unpleasant for the suspect
" However, less for man arrested and jailed, have his house searched, stand trial court, yet all this may properly happen the most innocent given probable cause, warrant, indictment"
" Society has always paid stiff price for law and order, and peaceful interrogation not one the dark moments the law"
 This brief statement the competing considerations seems ample proof that the Court's preference highly debatable best and therefore not read into the Constitution
" However, may make the analysis more graphic consider the actual facts one the four cases reversed the Court"
" Miranda Arizona serves best, being neither the hardest nor easiest the four under the Court's standards"
" March 1963, 18-year-old girl was kidnapped and forcibly raped near Phoenix, Arizona"
" Ten days later, the morning March 13, petitioner Miranda was arrested and taken the police station"
" this time Miranda was years old, indigent, and educated the extent completing half the ninth grade"
" had ""an emotional illness"" the schizophrenic type, according the doctor who eventually examined him; the doctor's report also stated that Miranda was ""alert and oriented time, place, and person,"" intelligent within normal limits, competent stand trial, and sane within the legal definition"
" the police station, the victim picked Miranda out lineup, and two officers then took him into separate room interrogate him, starting about 11:30 Though first denying his guilt, within short time Miranda gave detailed oral confession and then wrote out his own hand and signed brief statement admitting and describing the crime"
" All this was accomplished two hours less without any force, threats promises and will assume this though the record uncertain, ante, without any effective warnings all"
 Miranda's oral and written confessions are now held inadmissible under the Court's new rules
 One entitled feel astonished that the Constitution can read produce this result
" These confessions were obtained during brief, daytime questioning conducted two officers and unmarked any the traditional indicia coercion"
" They assured conviction for brutal and unsettling crime, for which the police had and quite possibly could obtain little evidence other than the victim's identifications, evidence which frequently unreliable"
" There was, sum, legitimate purpose, perceptible unfairness, and certainly little risk injustice the interrogation"
" Yet the resulting confessions, and the responsible course police practice they represent, are sacrificed the Court's own finespun conception fairness which seriously doubt shared many thinking citizens this country"
 The tenor judicial opinion also falls well short supporting the Court's new approach
" Although Escobedo has widely been interpreted open invitation lower courts rewrite the law confessions, significant heavy majority the state and federal decisions point have sought quite narrow interpretations"
"the courts that have accepted the invitation, hard know how many have felt compelled their best guess this Court's likely construction; but none the state decisions saw fit rely the state privilege against self-incrimination, and decision all has gone far this Court goes today"
" also instructive compare the attitude this case those responsible for law enforcement with the official views that existed when the Court undertook three major revisions prosecutorial practice prior this case, Johnson Zerbst"
"Johnson, which established that appointed counsel must offered the indigent federal criminal trials, the Federal Government all but conceded the basic issue, which had fact been recently fixed Department Justice policy"
" Mapp, which imposed the exclusionary rule the States for Fourth Amendment violations, more than half the States had themselves already adopted some such rule"
"Gideon, which extended Johnson Zerbst the States, amicus brief was filed States and Commonwealths urging that course; only two States besides that the respondent came forward protest"
"contrast, this case new restrictions police questioning have been opposed the United States and amicus brief signed States and Commonwealths, not including the three other States which are parties"
" State the country has urged this Court impose the newly announced rules, nor has any State chosen nearly far its own"
 The Court closing its general discussion invokes the practice federal and foreign jurisdictions lending weight its new curbs confessions for all the States
 brief resume will suffice show that none these jurisdictions has struck one-sided balance the Court does today
 Heaviest reliance placed the FBI practice
" Differing circumstances may make this comparison quite untrustworthy, but any event the FBI falls sensibly short the Court's formalistic rules"
" For example, there indication that FBI agents must obtain affirmative ""waiver"" before they pursue their questioning"
 Nor clear that one invoking his right silence may not prevailed upon change his mind
 And the warning appointed counsel apparently indicates only that one will assigned the judge when the suspect appears before him; the thrust the Court's rules induce the suspect obtain appointed counsel before continuing the interview
" Apparently American military practice, briefly mentioned the Court, has these same limits and still less favorable the suspect than the FBI warning, making mention appointed counsel"
 The law the foreign countries described the Court also reflects more moderate conception the rights the accused against those society when other data are considered
" Concededly, the English experience most relevant"
" that country, caution silence but not counsel has long been mandated the ""Judges' Rules,"" which also place other somewhat imprecise limits police cross-examination suspects"
" However, the court's discretion confessions can and apparently quite frequently are admitted evidence despite disregard the Judges' Rules, long they are found voluntary under the common-law test"
" Moreover, the check that exists the use pretrial statements counterbalanced the evident admissibility fruits illegal confession and the judge's often-used authority comment adversely the defendant's failure testify"
" India, Ceylon and Scotland are the other examples chosen the Court"
" India and Ceylon the general ban police-adduced confessions cited the Court subject major exception: evidence uncovered police questioning, fully admissible trial along with the confession itself, far relates the evidence and not blatantly coerced"
" Scotland's limits interrogation measure the Court's; however, restrained comment trial the defendant's failure take the stand allowed the judge, and many other respects Scotch law redresses the prosecutor's disadvantage ways not permitted this country"
" The Court ends its survey imputing  added strength our privilege against self-incrimination since, contrast other countries, embodied written Constitution"
" Considering the liberties the Court has today taken with constitutional history and precedent, few will find this emphasis persuasive"
" closing this necessarily truncated discussion policy considerations attending the new confession rules, some reference must made their ironic untimeliness"
 There now progress this country massive re-examination criminal law enforcement procedures scale never before witnessed

" Studies are also being conducted the District Columbia Crime Commission, the Georgetown Law Center, and others equipped practical research"
 There are also signs that legislatures some the States may preparing re-examine the problem before us
 secret that concern has been expressed lest long-range and lasting reforms frustrated this Court's too rapid departure from existing constitutional standards
" Despite the Court's disclaimer, the practical effect the decision made today must inevitably handicap seriously sound efforts reform, not least removing options necessary just compromise competing interests"
" course legislative reform rarely speedy unanimous, though this Court has been more patient the past"
" But the legislative reforms when they come would have the vast advantage empirical data and comprehensive study, they would allow experimentation and use solutions not open the courts, and they would restore the initiative criminal law reform those forums where truly belongs"
 CONCLUSIONS
" All four the cases involved here present express claims that confessions were inadmissible, not because coercion the traditional due process sense, but solely because lack counsel lack warnings concerning counsel and silence"
" For the reasons stated this opinion, would adhere the due process test and reject the new requirements inaugurated the Court"
 this premise disposition each these cases can stated briefly
" two the three cases coming from state courts, Miranda Arizonaand Vignera New York the confessions were held admissible and other errors worth comment are alleged petitioners would affirm these two cases"
" The other state case California Stewart , where the state supreme court held the confession inadmissible and reversed the conviction"
 that case would dismiss the writ certiorari the ground that final judgment before us
"putting aside the new trial open the State any event, the confession itself has not even been finally excluded since the California Supreme Court left the State free show proof waiver"
" the merits the decision Stewart reached, then believe should reversed and the case remanded the state supreme court may pass the other claims available respondent"
" the federal case, Westover United States "
number issues are raised petitioner apart from the one already dealt with this dissent
" None these other claims appears tenable, nor this context warrant extended discussion"
" urged that the confession was also inadmissible because not voluntary even measured due process standards and because federal-state cooperation brought the McNabb-Mallory rule into play under Anderson United States,"
" However, the facts alleged fall well short coercion view, and believe the involvement federal agents petitioner's arrest and detention the State too slight invoke Anderson"
" agree with the Government that the admission the evidence now protested petitioner was most harmless error, and two final contentions one involving weight the evidence and another improper prosecutor comment seem without merit"
 would therefore affirm Westover's conviction

"(""a confession not rejected because any connection with the privilege against self-crimination""), and 250, (particularly criticizing Bram); Wigmore, Evidence 2266, 400-401 (McNaughton rev"
" Whatever the source the rule excluding coerced confessions, clear that prior the application the privilege itself state courts, Malloy Hogan, "
 the admissibility confession state criminal prosecution was tested the same standards were applied federal prosecutions
" Bram, however, itself rejected the proposition which the Court now espouses"
" The question Bram was whether confession, obtained during custodial interrogation, had been compelled, and such interrogation was deemed inherently vulnerable the Court's inquiry could have ended there"
" After examining the English and American authorities, however, the Court declared that: ""In this court also has been settled that the mere fact that the confession made police officer, while the accused was under arrest out prison, was drawn out his questions, does not necessarily render the confession involuntary, but, one the circumstances, such imprisonment interrogation may taken into account determining whether not the statements the prisoner were voluntary"
this respect the Court was wholly consistent with prior and subsequent pronouncements this Court
" Thus prior Bram the Court, Hopt Utah, had upheld the admissibility confession made police officers following arrest, the record being silent concerning what conversation had occurred between the officers and the defendant the short period preceding the confession"
" ""Counsel for the accused insist that there cannot voluntary statement, free open confession, while defendant confined and irons under accusation having committed capital offence"
 have not been referred any authority support that position
" true that the fact prisoner being custody the time makes confession circumstance not overlooked, because bears upon the inquiry whether the confession was voluntarily made was extorted threats violence made under the influence fear"
" But confinement imprisonment not itself sufficient justify the exclusion confession, appears have been voluntary, and was not obtained putting the prisoner fear promises"
the Court had considered the significance custodial interrogation without any antecedent warnings regarding the right remain silent the right counsel
" There the defendant had answered questions posed Commissioner, who had failed advise him his rights, and his answers were held admissible over his claim involuntariness"
" ""The fact that defendant] custody and manacled does not necessarily render his statement involuntary, nor that necessarily the effect popular excitement shortly preceding"
" And laid down  that not essential the admissibility confession that should appear that the person was warned that what said would used against him, but the contrary, the confession was voluntary, sufficient though appear that was not warned"
""" Since Bram, the admissibility statements made during custodial interrogation has been frequently reiterated"
" Powers United States, cited Wilson approvingly and held admissible voluntary statements the accused's testimony preliminary hearing even though was not warned that what said might used against him"
" Without any discussion the presence absence warnings, presumably because such discussion was deemed unnecessary, numerous other cases have declared that ""[t]he mere fact that confession was made while the custody the police does not render inadmissible,"" McNabb United States, accord, United States Mitchell, despite its having been elicited police examination, Wan United States"
"the Court said that ""the bare fact police `detention and police examination private one official state custody' does not render involuntary confession the one detained"
""" And finally, Cicenia Lagay, confession obtained police interrogation after arrest was held voluntary even though the authorities refused permit the defendant consult with his attorney"
" Only tiny minority our judges who have dealt with the question, including today's majority, have considered in-custody interrogation, without more, violation the Fifth Amendment"
" And this Court, every member knows, has left standing literally thousands criminal convictions that rested least part confessions taken the course interrogation the police after arrest"
" That the Court's holding today neither compelled nor even strongly suggested the language the Fifth Amendment, odds with American and English legal history, and involves departure from long line precedent does not prove either that the Court has exceeded its powers that the Court wrong unwise its present reinterpretation the Fifth Amendment"
" does, however, underscore the obvious that the Court has not discovered found the law making today's decision, nor has derived from some irrefutable sources; what has done make new law and new public policy much the same way that has the course interpreting other great clauses the Constitution"
 This what the Court historically has done
" Indeed, what must and will continue until and unless there some fundamental change the constitutional distribution governmental powers"
" But the Court here and now announce new and fundamental policy govern certain aspects our affairs, wholly legitimate examine the mode this any other constitutional decision this Court and inquire into the advisability its end product terms the long-range interest the country"
 the very least the Court's text and reasoning should withstand analysis and fair exposition the constitutional provision which its opinion interprets
" Decisions like these cannot rest alone syllogism, metaphysics some ill-defined notions natural justice, although each will perhaps play its part"
" proceeding such constructions now announces, the Court should also duly consider all the factors and interests bearing upon the cases, least insofar the relevant materials are available; and the necessary considerations are not treated the record obtainable from some other reliable source, the Court should not proceed formulate fundamental policies based speculation alone"
" First, may inquire what are the textual and factual bases this new fundamental rule"
" reach the result announced the grounds does, the Court must stay within the confines the Fifth Amendment, which forbids self-incrimination only compelled"
" Hence the core the Court's opinion that because the ""compulsion inherent custodial surroundings, statement obtained from [a] defendant [in custody] can truly the product his free choice,"" ante, 458, absent the use adequate protective devices described the Court"
" However, the Court does not point any sudden inrush new knowledge requiring the rejection years' experience"
" Nor does assert that its novel conclusion reflects changing consensus among state courts, see Mapp Ohio, that succession cases had steadily eroded the old rule and proved unworkable, see Gideon Wainwright"
"Rather than asserting new knowledge, the Court concedes that cannot truly know what occurs during custodial questioning, because the innate secrecy such proceedings"
" extrapolates picture what conceives the norm from police investigatorial manuals, published 1959 and 1962 earlier, without any attempt allow for adjustments police practices that may [384 U"
have occurred the wake more recent decisions state appellate tribunals this Court
" But even the relentless application the described procedures could lead involuntary confessions, most assuredly does not follow that each and every case will disclose this kind interrogation this kind consequence"
" Insofar appears from the Court's opinion, has not examined single transcript any police interrogation, let alone the interrogation that took place any one these cases which decides today"
 Judged any the standards for empirical investigation utilized the social sciences the factual basis for the Court's premise patently inadequate
" Although the Court's view in-custody interrogation inherently coercive, the Court says that the spontaneous product the coercion arrest and detention still deemed voluntary"
" accused, arrested probable cause, may blurt out confession which will admissible despite the fact that alone and custody, without any showing that had any notion his right remain silent the consequences his admission"
" Yet, under the Court's rule, the police ask him single question such ""Do you have anything say?"" ""Did you kill your wife?"" his response, there one, has somehow been compelled, even the accused has been clearly warned his right remain silent"
 Common sense informs the contrary
" While one may say that the response was ""involuntary"" the sense the question provoked was the occasion for the response and thus the defendant was induced speak out when might have remained silent not arrested and not questioned, patently unsound say the response compelled"
 Today's result would not follow even were agreed that some extent custodial interrogation inherently coercive
" The test has been whether the totality circumstances deprived the defendant ""free choice admit, deny, refuse answer,"" Lisenba California, and whether physical psychological coercion was such degree that ""the defendant's will was overborne the time confessed,"" Haynes Washington"
"The duration and nature incommunicado custody, the presence absence advice concerning the defendant's constitutional rights, and the granting refusal requests communicate with lawyers, relatives friends have all been rightly regarded important data bearing the basic inquiry"
"But has never been suggested, until today, that such questioning was coercive and accused persons lacking hardihood that the very first response the very first question following the commencement custody must conclusively presumed the product overborne will"
" the rule announced today were truly based conclusion that all confessions resulting from custodial interrogation are coerced, then would simply have rational foundation"
"fortiori that would true the extension the rule exculpatory statements, which the Court effects after brief discussion why, the Court's view, they must deemed incriminatory but without any discussion why they must deemed coerced"
"Even one were postulate that the Court's concern not that all confessions induced police interrogation are coerced but rather that some such confessions are coerced and present judicial procedures are believed inadequate identify the confessions that are coerced and those that are not, would still not essential impose the rule that the Court has now fashioned"
" Transcripts observers could required, specific time limits, tailored fit the cause, could imposed, other devices could utilized reduce the chances that otherwise indiscernible coercion will produce inadmissible confession"
" the other hand, even one assumed that there was adequate factual basis for the conclusion that all confessions obtained during in-custody interrogation are the product compulsion, the rule propounded the Court would still irrational, for, apparently, only the accused also warned his right counsel and waives both that right and the right against self-incrimination that the inherent compulsiveness interrogation disappears"
" But the defendant may not answer without warning question such ""Where were you last night?"" without having his answer compelled one, how can the Court ever accept his negative answer the question whether wants consult his retained counsel counsel whom the court will appoint? And why counsel present and the accused nevertheless confesses, counsel tells the accused tell the truth, and that what the accused does, the situation any less coercive insofar the accused concerned? The Court apparently realizes its dilemma foreclosing questioning without the necessary warnings but the same time permitting the accused, sitting the same chair front the same policemen, waive his right consult attorney"
" expects, however, that the accused will not often waive the right; and claimed that has, the State faces severe, not impossible burden proof"
 All this makes very little sense terms the compulsion which the Fifth Amendment proscribes
 That amendment deals with compelling the accused himself
 his free will that involved
" Confessions and incriminating admissions, such, are not forbidden evidence; only those which are compelled are banned"
 doubt that the Court observes these distinctions today
" considering any answers any interrogation compelled regardless the content and course examination and escalating the requirements prove waiver, the Court not only prevents the use compelled confessions but for all practical purposes forbids interrogation except the presence counsel"
" That is, instead confining itself protection the right against compelled self-incrimination the Court has created limited Fifth Amendment right counsel or, the Court expresses it, ""need for counsel protect the Fifth Amendment privilege Ante"
 The focus then not the will the accused but the will counsel and how much influence can have the accused
 Obviously there warrant the Fifth Amendment for thus installing counsel the arbiter the privilege
" sum, for all the Court's expounding the menacing atmosphere police interrogation procedures, has failed supply any foundation for the conclusions draws the measures adopts"
" Criticism the Court's opinion, however, cannot stop with demonstration that the factual and textual bases for the rule propounds are, best, less than compelling"
 Equally relevant assessment the rule's consequences measured against community values
" The Court's duty assess the consequences its action not satisfied the utterance the truth that value our system criminal justice ""to respect the inviolability the human personality"" and require government produce the evidence against the accused its own independent labors"
 More than the human dignity the accused involved; the human personality others the society must also preserved
 Thus the values reflected the privilege are not the sole desideratum; society's interest the general security equal weight
 The obvious underpinning the Court's decision deep-seated distrust all confessions
" the Court declares that the accused may not interrogated without counsel present, absent waiver the right counsel, and the Court all but admonishes the lawyer advise the accused remain silent, the result adds judicial judgment that evidence from the accused should not used against him any way, whether compelled not"
 This the not subtle overtone the opinion that inherently wrong for the police gather evidence from the accused himself
 And this precisely the nub this dissent
" see nothing wrong immoral, and certainly nothing unconstitutional, the police's asking suspect whom they have reasonable cause arrest whether not killed his wife confronting him with the evidence which the arrest was based, least where has been plainly advised that may remain completely silent, see Escobedo Illinois, (dissenting opinion)"
" Until today, ""the admissions confessions the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high the scale incriminating evidence"
" Particularly when corroborated, where the police have confirmed the accused's disclosure the hiding place implements fruits the crime, such confessions have the highest reliability and significantly contribute the certitude with which may believe the accused guilty"
" Moreover, means certain that the process confessing injurious the accused"
 the contrary may provide psychological relief and enhance the prospects for rehabilitation
 This not say that the value respect for the inviolability the accused's individual personality should accorded weight that all confessions should indiscriminately admitted
" This Court has long read the Constitution proscribe compelled confessions, salutary rule from which there should retreat"
" But see sound basis, factual otherwise, and the Court gives none, for concluding that the present rule against the receipt coerced confessions inadequate for the task sorting out inadmissible evidence and must replaced the per rule which now imposed"
" Even the new concept can said have advantages some sort over the present law, they are far outweighed its likely undesirable impact other very relevant and important interests"
 The most basic function any government provide for the security the individual and his property
" Lanzetta New Jersey, These ends society are served the criminal laws which for the most part are aimed the prevention crime"
" Without the reasonably effective performance the task preventing private violence and retaliation, idle talk about human dignity and civilized values"
 The modes which the criminal laws serve the interest general security are many
" First the murderer who has taken the life another removed from the streets, deprived his liberty and thereby prevented from repeating his offense"
" view the statistics recidivism this country and the number instances which apprehension occurs only after repeated offenses, one can sensibly claim that this aspect the criminal law does not prevent crime contribute significantly the personal security the ordinary citizen"
" Secondly, the swift and sure apprehension those who refuse respect the personal security and dignity their neighbor unquestionably has its impact others who might similarly tempted"
" That the criminal law wholly partly ineffective with segment the population with many those who have been apprehended and convicted very faulty basis for concluding that not effective with respect the great bulk our citizens for thinking that without the criminal laws, the absence their enforcement, there would increase crime"
 Arguments this nature are not borne out any kind reliable evidence that have seen this date
" Thirdly, the law concerns itself with those whom has confined"
" The hope and aim modern penology, fortunately, soon possible return the convict society better and more law-abiding man than when left"
" Sometimes there success, sometimes failure"
" But least the effort made, and should made the very maximum extent our present and future capabilities"
 The rule announced today will measurably weaken the ability the criminal law perform these tasks
" deliberate calculus prevent interrogations, reduce the incidence confessions and pleas guilty and increase the number trials"
" Criminal trials, matter how efficient the police are, are not sure bets for the prosecution, nor should they the evidence not forthcoming"
" Under the present law, the prosecution fails prove its case about 30% the criminal cases actually tried the federal courts"
" See Federal Offenders: 1964, supra, note (Table 4), (Table 1); Federal Offenders: 1963, supra, note (Table 3); District Columbia Offenders: 1963, supra, note (Table 1)"
 But something else again remove from the ordinary criminal case all those confessions which heretofore have been held free and voluntary acts the accused and thus establish new constitutional barrier the ascertainment truth the judicial process
" There is, view, every reason believe that good many criminal defendants who otherwise would have been convicted what this Court has previously thought the most satisfactory kind evidence will now, under this new version the Fifth Amendment, either not tried all will acquitted the State's evidence, minus the confession, put the test litigation"
 have desire whatsoever share the responsibility for any such impact the present criminal process
" some unknown number cases the Court's rule will return killer, rapist other criminal the streets and the environment which produced him, repeat his crime whenever pleases him"
" consequence, there will not gain, but loss, human dignity"
" The real concern not the unfortunate consequences this new decision the criminal law abstract, disembodied series authoritative proscriptions, but the impact those who rely the public authority for protection and who without can only engage violent self-help with guns, knives and the help their neighbors similarly inclined"
" There is, course, saving factor: the next victims are uncertain, unnamed and unrepresented this case"
 Nor can this decision other than have corrosive effect the criminal law effective device prevent crime
 major component its effectiveness this regard its swift and sure enforcement
" The easier get away with rape and murder, the less the deterrent effect those who are inclined attempt it"
 This still good common sense
" were not, should posthaste liquidate the whole law enforcement establishment useless, misguided effort control human conduct"
" And what about the accused who has confessed would confess response simple, noncoercive questioning and whose guilt could not otherwise proved? clear that release the best thing for him every case? Has unquestionably been resolved that each and every case would better for him not confess and return his environment with attempt whatsoever help him? think not"
 may well that many cases will less than callous disregard for his own welfare well for the interests his next victim
 There another aspect the effect the Court's rule the person whom the police have arrested probable cause
 The fact that may not guilty all and may able extricate himself quickly and simply were told the circumstances his arrest and were asked explain
" This effort, and his release, must now await the hiring lawyer his appointment the court, consultation with counsel and then session with the police the prosecutor"
" Similarly, where probable cause exists arrest several suspects, where the body the victim discovered house having several residents, compare Johnson State, 238 Md"
true that suspect may cleared only through the results interrogation other suspects
 Here too the release the innocent may delayed the Court's rule
" Much the trouble with the Court's new rule that will operate indiscriminately all criminal cases, regardless the severity the crime the circumstances involved"
" applies every defendant, whether the professional criminal one committing crime momentary passion who not part and parcel organized crime"
" will slow down the investigation and the apprehension confederates those cases where time the essence, such kidnapping, see Brinegar United States, 338 U"
"(upholding, espionage case, trial ruling that Government need not submit classified portions interrogation transcript), and some those involving organized crime"
 the latter context the lawyer who arrives may also the lawyer for the defendant's colleagues and can relied upon insure that breach the organization's security takes place even though the accused may feel that the best thing can cooperate
" the same time, the Court's per approach may not justified the ground that provides ""bright line"" permitting the authorities judge advance whether interrogation may safely pursued without jeopardizing the admissibility any information obtained consequence"
" Nor can claimed that judicial time and effort, assuming that relevant consideration, will conserved because the ease application the new rule"
" Today's decision leaves open such questions whether the accused was custody, whether his statements were spontaneous the product interrogation, whether the accused has effectively waived his rights, and whether nontestimonial evidence introduced trial the fruit statements made during prohibited interrogation, all which are certain prove productive uncertainty during investigation and litigation during prosecution"
" For all these reasons, further restrictions police interrogation are desirable this time, more flexible approach makes much more sense than the Court's constitutional straitjacket which forecloses more discriminating treatment legislative rule-making pronouncements"
" Applying the traditional standards the cases before the Court, would hold these confessions voluntary"
 would therefore affirm Nos
" Footnote course the Court does not deny that departing from prior precedent; expressly overrules Crooker and Cicenia, ante, 479, 48, and acknowledges that the instant ""cases might not find the defendants' statements have been involuntary traditional terms,"" ante, 457"
" Footnote fact, the type sustained interrogation described the Court appears the exception rather than the rule"

" Questioning tends confused and sporadic and usually concentrated confrontations with witnesses new items evidence, these are obtained officers conducting the investigation"
" See generally LaFave, Arrest: The Decision Take Suspect into Custody 386 (1965); ALI, Model Code Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Commentary 5"
" Footnote contrast, the Court indicates that applying this new rule ""will not pause inquire individual cases whether the defendant was aware his rights without warning being given"
